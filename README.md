### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kiha Jeong, and I'm a software developer in Korea.

My entire life, Iâ€™ve been **pushing the envelope** and giving only the best of me. My major is Finance, but I want to make a service that changes peopleâ€™s future - so I decided to become a developer.

I develop software that is **easy** to use, easy to develop and **expand** on. When I confront a problem, Iâ€™m **immersed** in solving that problem day and night. I have been involved in developing an API gateway solution, and several API servers. I always think of the **users** when developing, my aim is to continually improve peopleâ€™s **lifestyles** - which I think is easy for me, because Iâ€™m not just a developer, Iâ€™m a **big dreamer**.

**Let's make a dent in the universe, together.**
